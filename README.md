# odin-recipes
This page has been set up to showcase my current abilities in web development.
By this point The Odin Project (TOP) has shown me how to create the HTML boilerplate, how to use some basic elements and attributes to create a layout of a website, and how to push my code to Git Hub. 
I must remember that it's still early days, so I should remember to refer to the course if stuck.
I will nevertheless do my best to create a functioning web page.
